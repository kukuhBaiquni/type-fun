        This website provide information about Elsword, if you don&apos;t know, see {elswordGame}
        . This website is made for personal use only.
        It contains information about in-game characters, towns, dungeons, titles, equipments, costumes, and many more.
        but not all information is available here. {elwiki} (multilingual database for the game {elswordGame}) has more than 18k articles, which is a very large number, here I created the website to collect few information related to {elswordGame} from there.
