She wanted to create a robot unmatched in power and beauty. In her search, Rose learned about the El Energy extractor used by the Nasods in Altera. This allowed her to remodel her equipment decreasing them in size and making them more visually appealing without compromising their capabilities. She now stands in the battlefield as the Goddess of Machines with refined robots and unstoppable power."
